âœ… Output Review
The calculator delivers accurate and instantaneous results for standard arithmetic operationsâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It handles user inputs efficiently, displaying calculations in real-time without needing a page refresh.
ðŸ§® Key highlights:
- Outputs update dynamically with each button press
- Handles edge cases like multiple decimal inputs and division by zero (if implemented)
- Smooth visual feedback for every interaction
- Consistent behavior across different browsers and screen sizes
This output validation process reinforced the importance of precision in logic flow and robustness in input handling, ensuring a seamless user experience.
